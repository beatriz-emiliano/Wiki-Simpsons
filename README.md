# Wiki-Simpsons
In this project a game was developed in the Python language, based on the existing game called 'Akinator'. The game aims to instigate the code to find out what the user is thinking. For this, the program asks some questions until it reaches the character that the user thought. The idea arose from the desire to combine what we learned in RASb√≥ticas IEEE UFCG with something that brought our identity. In this way, we added a Python language to the Simpsons and that was how Wiki-Simpsons came about.
